# Lakebay-Geeks
The Lakebay Geeks football tactics. A football team in the lowest division in Sweden, Gothenburg. Issues and Pull Requests for new game tactics welcome.

# Team culture:
A culture is the expression of a team’s values, attitudes, and goals about sports, competition, and relationships. It determines whether, for example, the team’s focus is on fun, improvement, or winning or whether it promotes individual accomplishment, simply exercise or team success.

1.1 Each team member needs to think about what the values for playing in Lakebay Geeks are and see the broad picture of this hobby. Yes winning is more fun but it is not the only reson we are here for.


# Gamplay tactics:
Football is a simple game the goal is to score more goals than the opponent. This said it still is a bit tricky to get players syncronized. If you have played/watched football you know it is a bit like chess.

2.1 Occupying the centre is given very high importance. To evaluate further on this it is usually within the penalty areas where the games are solved. Winning goals or winning saves and defensive acts are made within the penalty area (area near and around the goal). We want to push the offense to the sides and corners and penetrate the opponents goal area in offence.

2.2 We want to build the offensie game by rolling the ball from the keeper and building a passing game. Beeing able to save energy means we need to keep the ball within our team for longer periods of time. This said we do not want to compromiss on playing safe within our own defensive area. Here the idea is to open up passing angles to the player who has the ball, actively run to open areas and get the ball high up opponents area and still keep it. Last year 2019 we saw that when we use skilled passing players on the lower midfield and defence we wereable to build the passing game, even if someone plays as a forward it does not mean he or she can particiate in the building of the attack and search the ball lower in the field.

2.3 To create a winning tactic it is recommended to react/act on how the opponent is playing.
- If the opponent has a high and heavy pressure we need to find open areas to play the ball upfields. This said it is also lucrative on beeing able to play past a pressuring team even it is by passing the ball on the floor, the opponent uses alot of energy and if we can play aroudn them they will become breathless in the end. 
- If the opponent has a dangerous attacker we need to shut him down by defending him more strongly.
- We should have two different tactics on the offensive start, rolling the boll from the keeper as opponents have different ways of playing.

2.4 Uncontrolled balls near or own goal should fly long and far away from our goal, we need to clear the ball if it is in danger area.

2.5 When defending we should always think of defending together. As an individual a good simple way of thinking that it should be always hard to play past myself and it should not be easy to pass me out and instead i want to be part of the defensive wall. If you feel you are not part of the defence then run to a place where you are pushing the opponent to the sides and corners. When we loose the ball there is many times an about 3sec time to win it back othervide it is simpler to fall down.

2.6 Last year 2019 we started winning point when "parking the buss" aka falling down with the team and playing better passing game after rolling the ball from the keeper. Against good teams we still need to fall down and park the buss defend, defend, defende and then launch th contra attacks, trust me on this one it is more surprising to attack and score against a good team that gets frustrated on not scoring a goal. This said it can become wearing and tiresome to use this tactic and if we keep loosing the ball again after a long defence it will be miserable. Suggstion would be that we find out the opponents leve and weakest points, try to maintain a good passing game from the build of and if the passing game does not work then we just need to say a prayer.

Team culture
============
A culture is the expression of a team’s values, attitudes, and goals about sports, competition, and relationships. It determines whether, for example, the team’s focus is on fun, improvement, or winning or whether it promotes individual accomplishment, simply exercise or team success.

1.1 Each team member needs to think about what the values for playing in Lakebay Geeks are and see the broad picture of this hobby. Yes winning is more fun but it is not the only reson we are here for.


Gameplay tactics
================
Football is a simple game the goal is to score more goals than the opponent. This said it still is a bit tricky to get players syncronized. If you have played/watched football you know it is a bit like chess.

Tactic that we took most points year 2019 was when we started playing a setup of 3-1-2 or 3-2-1. As of 3 defensive players and 1-2 defensive/offensive midfielders and 1-2 attackers. This said the formation beeing whatever does not mater as it is always the players decission on how he or she will move in the possition and what areas to occupy.

The idea is to have players who want to build the passing game and create short passing on our own half and deliver ball to the central half of the pitch and then further. At times we also want to have one attaker high up in the field to stretch the opponent and create space in between their defence and attack and play the ball to this open space. There are no offsides n Korpen so our attacker can be at times high up between the opponents goalkeeper and their defence line and crate mental stress to their defence just by standing out of sight, then it depends on the opponent how they deal with it and if they use man against man marking on the forward we have accomplished to stretch their team.

- 2.1 Occupying the centre is given very high importance. To evaluate further on this it is usually within the penalty areas where the games are solved. Winning goals or winning saves and defensive acts are made within the penalty area (area near and around the goal). We want to push the offense to the sides and corners and penetrate the opponents goal area in offence.

- 2.2 We want to build the offensie game by rolling the ball from the keeper and building a passing game. Beeing able to save energy means we need to keep the ball within our team for longer periods of time. This said we do not want to compromiss on playing safe within our own defensive area. Here the idea is to open up passing angles to the player who has the ball, actively run to open areas and get the ball high up opponents area and still keep it. Last year 2019 we saw that when we use skilled passing players on the lower midfield and defence we wereable to build the passing game, even if someone plays as a forward it does not mean he or she can particiate in the building of the attack and search the ball lower in the field.

- 2.3 To create a winning tactic it is recommended to react/act on how the opponent is playing.
* If the opponent has a high and heavy pressure we need to find open areas to play the ball upfields. This said it is also lucrative on beeing able to play past a pressuring team even it is by passing the ball on the floor, the opponent uses alot of energy and if we can play aroudn them they will become breathless in the end. 
* If the opponent has a dangerous attacker we need to shut him down by defending him more strongly.
* We should have two different tactics on the offensive start, rolling the boll from the keeper as opponents have different ways of playing.

- 2.4 Uncontrolled balls near or own goal should fly long and far away from our goal, we need to clear the ball if it is in danger area.

- 2.5 When defending we should always think of defending together. As an individual a good simple way of thinking that it should be always hard to play past myself and it should not be easy to pass me out and instead i want to be part of the defensive wall. If you feel you are not part of the defence then run to a place where you are pushing the opponent to the sides and corners. When we loose the ball there is many times an about 3sec time to win it back othervide it is simpler to fall down.

- 2.6 Last year 2019 we started winning point when "parking the buss" aka falling down with the team and playing better passing game after rolling the ball from the keeper. Against good teams we still need to fall down and park the buss defend, defend, defende and then launch th contra attacks, trust me on this one it is more surprising to attack and score against a good team that gets frustrated on not scoring a goal. This said it can become wearing and tiresome to use this tactic and if we keep loosing the ball again after a long defence it will be miserable. Suggstion would be that we find out the opponents leve and weakest points, try to maintain a good passing game from the build of and if the passing game does not work then we just need to say a prayer.

Substitution Strategy
---------------------
As a member of the team everyone should be aware of the importance of circulation of players and substitution. This is important not only for sharing the stamina burden, but also giving fair opportunity to all players to take enough playing time. To be able to grant this i believe that makes sense to bring some rules about substitution.

- No need to mention maybe, it is de-facto when it comes to substitution : if you are tired, change immediately
- There should be a structural strategy to changing orders depending on the bench as well of course
    - There could be a strategy to make positional groups and player change inside the positional group
    - There could be pairs if there are enought players on the bench (it means 6 player on the bench)
    - There could be a one huge queue (not stack) that could be tracked.
- There should not be more than 5 minutes in the pitch without any substitution
    - A decision might be necessary about who will follow this. (Captain, bench, audience, etc.)
